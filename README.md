## The _Diamond Grid_

The _diamond grid_ is a method that I've developed for improvising. In order to understand it, you need to know a bit of music theory. If you know the seven modes (ionian, dorian, phrygian, etc.) you understand that almost all the music and scales in occidental music are based on the major scale, and that it gives origin to a number of scales just by starting on a different degree.

Ok. What is this for?

The worst thing a musician can do to play is to learn common licks, scales, chords. Such approach is completely nocive to creativity. My approach is based on the major scale, with any possible modifications applicable to the adequate scale, upon the same figure. If a musician is able to play without falling into wrong notes, 80% of the road to make real music (to express feelings) is done. The problem is usually that it is very, very, very difficult to know which are the wrong notes on the guitar. This method solves that problem with an elegant and modern approach.

This is the _diamond grid_. The _diamond grid_ is the permanent and universal pattern that the notes follow on a guitar.

The only thing one needs to know in order to play is the tonic of the song (or the section), and then, set the tonic to the _T_ letter on the grid by moving the grid left or right. For example, if the tonic note is _C_, then moving the grid to have the 5th string on C makes the _T_ to be positioned on the 3rd fret, 5th string. Then, you can see that there's a red line on the 5th fret. That means any note on such line could be played without leaving the _C_ scale.

Once you've learned the right notes on the guitar, you can develop your own chords, licks and moreover, play whatever lines or chords you want, without ever being wrong.

### Features

* The _diamond grid_ features two vertical parallel lines (in red), used commonly to play the _blues_. I call them the _dorian parallel_
* Five semitones at any side of the parallel lines, there's a vertical line which I call the _aeolian row_.
* There are no more vertical lines aside of the _dorian parallel_ and the _aeolian row_.
* A whole tone at both sides of the _aeolian row_, there are two interrupted lines (interrupted by holes on the 3rd and 2nd strings), which form two diamonds that give the name to this pattern. Learn the pattern and position of both diamonds.
* The blue patterns begin and end on the _dorian parallel_ and don't touch the _aeolian row_.
* With that, almost all notes of the major scale-based groups are covered. But some notes, essential to jazz are missing. If you don't play jazz, you can forget this notes. Otherwise, learn the patterns in orange. Both are neighbors of the diamonds.
* Believe it or not, with this approach, I've managed to improvise Giant Steps.
